Prediction Diabetes Dataset Using Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing

# Business Problem

ðŸ“Œ It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

# Dataset Story

ðŸ“Œ About this dataset:This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage

* Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies

* Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood

* BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement

* SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin

* Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood

* BMI: To express the Body mass index

* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage

* Age: To express the age

* **Outcome**: To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No
